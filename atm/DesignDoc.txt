Assumptions:-

    1. User can have multiple accounts. Each account will have one ATM card.
        class User{
            List<Account> accounts;
            Map<Card, Account>
        }
        class Account{
            String accountNumber;
            String accountType;
            double accountBalance;
            Card card;
        }
        class Card{
            String cardNumber;
            String cvv;
            String pin;
        }

Functionality:-
        1. User swipes the card and the card number is used to map to the related account after authentication via pin . Then all the operations are performed 
                on that particular account.
        2. Account will have balance and transaction history.
                class Transaction{
                    String id;
                    String txnType;  //withdraw or deposit or checkBalance or changePin
                    Timestamp timestamp;
                    double amount;
                    boolean isSuccessful;
                }

            Can be stored in a map like Map<Account, List<Transactions>>?

            Service class will verify whether the user has sufficient account balance or atm has sufficient cash only for withdrawing.
            If the above conditions satisfies then the transaction would be marked as successful. And the transaction would be addd to tansaction history in DAO 
            and account balance should be updated.

        3. ATM will hve a maximum cash capacity.
            On withdrawals Service class will check the available ATM cash before dispnsing cash to make sure the user doesnt withdraws more cash than the available
            amount.
