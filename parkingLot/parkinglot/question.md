Design a parking lot system that can accommodate different types of vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, and buses. The system should allow vehicles to enter and exit the parking lot, keep track of available parking spots, and calculate parking fees based on the type of vehicle and duration of parking. Implement the system in object-oriented programming (OOP) using appropriate classes, methods, and data structures.

Solution:

To solve this problem, we can use OOP concepts to design classes that represent the different entities in the parking lot system. Here's a possible solution:

Classes:

ParkingLot: Represents the overall parking lot, and has attributes such as total number of parking spots, available spots, and a list of parked vehicles. It also has methods to enter and exit the parking lot, and calculate parking fees.
Vehicle: Represents a generic vehicle, with attributes such as type (car, motorcycle, bus), license plate number, and entry time.
Car, Motorcycle, Bus: Subclasses of the Vehicle class, representing specific types of vehicles, each with their own attributes and methods.
Methods:

ParkingLot.enter(vehicle: Vehicle): This method is called when a vehicle enters the parking lot. It checks if there are available parking spots of the appropriate type, and if so, adds the vehicle to the list of parked vehicles and updates the available spots.
ParkingLot.exit(vehicle: Vehicle): This method is called when a vehicle exits the parking lot. It removes the vehicle from the list of parked vehicles and updates the available spots. It also calculates the parking fees based on the duration of parking and the type of vehicle.
Vehicle.get_type(): This method returns the type of the vehicle (car, motorcycle, bus).
Vehicle.get_license_plate(): This method returns the license plate number of the vehicle.
Vehicle.get_entry_time(): This method returns the entry time of the vehicle.
Vehicle.calculate_parking_fee(exit_time: timestamp): This method calculates the parking fee for the vehicle based on the duration of parking and the type of vehicle.
Data Structures:

Parking spot availability: This can be represented as a boolean array, where each index represents a parking spot and the value indicates whether the spot is available or not.
List of parked vehicles: This can be represented as an array or a linked list, where each element represents a parked vehicle.
This is just one possible solution for the parking lot system. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the system. During the interview, it's important to communicate your thought process clearly, discuss possible edge cases, and explain your design decisions effectively.
